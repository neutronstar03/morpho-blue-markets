Technical details:
runtime: bun 1.3.0
frontend project made with React + Vite + React Router 7.x + TYPESCRIPT (that's a must)

Rendering is client-side only because it's hosted on GitHub Pages
Styling is done with Tailwind CSS
Wallet connection is done with Wagmi + Rainbowkit. I am *NOT* interested in Walletconnect and it's centralized nature, for now.
GraphQL is used to fetch data from the Morpho Blue API
